# Assets

To view the SVG hosted on github, enter the url of svg you need, such as :

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Haxida/Assets/main/logo-64.svg

Then, you can get the url below which can be used to display:

https://cdn.rawgit.com/Haxida/Assets/main/logo-64.svg

we replace the raw.githubusercontent.com by https://cdn.rawgit.com/ 

And it will create the correct visualization for us at: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Haxida/Assets@main/logo-64.svg 

While I am looking for a better way to be able to display the github hosted SVGs correctly, I think it is the best option. 

They are not empty files, just github for security avoids executing them.
